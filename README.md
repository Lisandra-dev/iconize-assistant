# Icon Folder Yaml

Intended to be used with [Iconize](https://github.com/FlorianWoelki/obsidian-iconize), [Mkdocs Material](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/reference/#setting-the-page-icon) (icons) and [Obsidian Publisher](https://obsidian-publisher.netlify.app/).

The idea is to add keys into the frontmatter:
- `icon` : `folderIcon/icon`
- `icon_file` : `[[iconFile]]` (only if the svg is not in `.obsidian` or other hidden folder)

Obsidian Publisher will send the `icon_file` into your Repository, and Mkdocs Material will use the `icon` key to display the icon.


## ⚙️ Usage

The plugin add a command to the command palette: `Iconize assistant : Add icon to frontmatter`
